  abstract="The goal of this roadmap paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art and identify research challenges when developing, deploying and managing self-adaptive software systems. Instead of dealing with a wide range of topics associated with the field, we focus on four essential topics of self-adaptation: design space for self-adaptive solutions, software engineering processes for self-adaptive systems, from centralized to decentralized control, and practical run-time verification {\&} validation for self-adaptive systems. For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010.",

  abstract = {Software systems dealing with distributed applications in changing environments normally require human supervision to continue operation in all conditions. These (re-)configuring, troubleshooting, and in general maintenance tasks lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. These problems are primarily due to the open-loop structure often followed in software development. Therefore, there is a high demand for management complexity reduction, management automation, robustness, and achieving all of the desired quality requirements within a reasonable cost and time range during operation. Self-adaptive software is a response to these demands; it is a closed-loop system with a feedback loop aiming to adjust itself to changes during its operation. These changes may stem from the software system's self (internal causes, e.g., failure) or context (external events, e.g., increasing requests from users). Such a system is required to monitor itself and its context, detect significant changes, decide how to react, and act to execute such decisions. These processes depend on adaptation properties (called self-* properties), domain characteristics (context information or models), and preferences of stakeholders. Noting these requirements, it is widely believed that new models and frameworks are needed to design self-adaptive software. This survey article presents a taxonomy, based on concerns of adaptation, that is, how, what, when and where, towards providing a unified view of this emerging area. Moreover, as adaptive systems are encountered in many disciplines, it is imperative to learn from the theories and models developed in these other areas. This survey article presents a landscape of research in self-adaptive software by highlighting relevant disciplines and some prominent research projects. This landscape helps to identify the underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.},

  abstract = {The complexity of information systems is increasing in recent years, leading to increased effort for maintenance and configuration. Self-adaptive systems (SASs) address this issue. Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to mobile devices with the emerging need for context adaptation. Therefore, it is beneficial that devices are able to adapt context. Hence, we propose to extend the definition of SASs and include context adaptation. This paper presents a taxonomy of self-adaptation and a survey on engineering SASs. Based on the taxonomy and the survey, we motivate a new perspective on SAS including context adaptation.}

  abstract = {Self-adaptive software systems are capable of adjusting their behavior at run-time to achieve certain objectives. Such systems typically employ analytical models specified at design-time to assess their characteristics at run-time and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However, prior to system's deployment, engineers often cannot foresee the changes in the environment, requirements, and system's operational profile. Therefore, any analytical model used in this setting relies on underlying assumptions that if not held at run-time make the analysis and hence the adaptation decisions inaccurate. We present and evaluate FeatUre-oriented Self-adaptatION (FUSION) framework, which aims to solve this problem by learning the impact of adaptation decisions on the system's goals. The framework (1) allows for automatic online fine-tuning of the adaptation logic to unanticipated conditions, (2) reduces the upfront effort required for building such systems, and (3) makes the run-time analysis of such systems very efficient.},

  abstract = {Cloud Computing is one of the most intensively developed solutions for large-scale distributed processing. Effective use of such environments, management of their high complexity and ensuring appropriate levels of Quality of Service (QoS) require advanced monitoring systems. Such monitoring systems have to support the scalability, adaptability and reliability of Cloud. Most of existing monitoring systems do not incorporate any Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for supporting the change inside the task stream or environment itself. They focus only on monitoring or enabling the control of the system as a part of a separated service. An effective monitoring system for the Cloud environment should gather information about all stages of tasks processing and should actively control the monitored environment. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Agent System based Cloud Monitoring (MAS-CM) model that supports the performance and security of tasks gathering, scheduling and execution processes in large-scale service-oriented environments. Such models are explicitly designed to control the performance and security objectives of the environment. In our work, we focus on prevention of unauthorized task injection and modification, optimization of scheduling process and maximization of resource usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of MAS-CM empirically using an evolutionary driven implementation of Independent Batch Scheduler and FastFlow framework. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the performance improvement.}

  abstract = {Billions of resources, such as cars, clothes, household appliances and even food are being connected to the Internet forming the Internet of Things (IoT). Subsets of these resources can work together to create new self-regulating IoT applications such as smart health, smart communities and smart homes. However, several challenging issues need to be addressed before this vision of applications based on IoT concepts becomes a reality. Because many IoT applications will be distributed over a large number of interacting devices, centralized control will not be possible and so open problems will need to be solved that relate to building locally operating self-organizing and self-adaptive systems. As an initial step in creating IoT applications with these features, this paper presents a Framework for IoT (FIoT). The approach is based on Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Machine Learning Techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. To illustrate the use of FIoT, the paper contains two different IoT applications: (i) Quantified Things and (ii) Smart traffic control. We show how flexible points of our framework are instantiated to generate these IoT application.}
