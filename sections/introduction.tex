The complexity of modern software systems is constantly growing.
Most of this growth in complexity stems from the 
"need to integrate several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems, 
and to extend that beyond company boundaries into the Internet" (Kephart and Chess, 2003 \cite*{VisionOfAutonomicComputing}).
\par
This has reached a state where the 
"complexity appears to be approaching the limits of human capability" (Kephart and Chess, 2003 \cite*{VisionOfAutonomicComputing}).
In combination with the uncertainty about a software systems future operations and environment,
that the developers of such complex systems face, it becomes uneconomical to purely operate a system by human operators.
\par
From this the need for software systems which can autonomously manage themselves arises.
In order to achieve this task of autonomous self-management, the system has to be able to:
% MAPE-K -> Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute with Knowledge
\begin{itemize}
    \item detect faults and changes in its environment.
    \item decide how to react to faults and changes in the systems environment.
    \item make changes to itself.
\end{itemize}
To model these abilities Kephart and Chess developed 
the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute with Knowledge) feedback loop \cite*{VisionOfAutonomicComputing}.
First the system has to monitor itself and its environment. 
The data, gathered by the monitoring step, has to be analyzed to detect changes and faults.
If the analyzing step detects, that an adaptation is necessary, 
the planning step plans which changes have to be made.
After the changes have been planned, they need to be executed.
All of this happens with Knowledge of the environment and the system.

Software systems that can autonomously manage themselves are called Self-Adaptive Systems
because of their ability to adapt themselves.

This approach to managing big software systems has many advantages.

While classical Self-Adaptive Systems can operate more complex systems than human operators,
they also have disadvantages compared to human operators.
