% TODO:
% - Today large systems ....
% - Need for SAS
% - What are the limits
% - The need for optimization that results from those limits
% - The need to classify these approaches

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item What are Self-Adaptive Systems?
%     \item Why are Self-Adaptive Systems useful?
%     \item What are the limits of classical Self-Adaptive Systems?
%     \item The need for optimizing Self-Adaptive Systems.
