\section{Classifying existing optimization approaches}
\label{ch:Existing}

% TODO:
% - Write a short explanation of each approach:
%     - FUSION
%     - Multi-Agent system
%     - Learning revised models
%     - Cloud performance and security
%     - FIoT
% - Classify each approach:
%     - FUSION
%     - Multi-Agent system
%     - Learning revised models
%     - Cloud performance and security
%     - FIoT
