\begin{abstract}
    \textbf{Abstract} \ \ The complexity of modern software systems is constantly growing.
    This requires new ways to be found to better manage large scale software systems.
    Self-Adaptive Systems which autonomously manage themselves using well-defined rules
    are a solution to this problem.
    Even tough these systems are able to adapt themselves,
    they struggle with unpredicted changes in their context.
    This can be solved by using Optimization Approaches for Self-Adaptive Systems which can optimize these systems.
    There are already many Optimization Approaches, but no way to classify them.
    This paper proposes a classification for Optimization Approaches for Self-Adaptive Systems.
