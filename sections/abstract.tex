    \textbf{Abstract} \ \ The complexity of modern software systems is constantly growing.
    This requires new ways to be found to better manage large scale software systems.
    \acrfull{sas}[s] which autonomously manage themselves using well-defined rules
    are a solution to this problem.
    Even though these systems are able to adapt themselves,
    they struggle with unpredicted changes in their environment.
    This can be solved by using \acrfull{oa}[es] for \acrshort{sas} which can optimize these systems.
    There are already many \acrshort{oa}, but no way to classify them.
    This paper proposes a classification for \acrshort{oa} for \acrshort{sas}.
